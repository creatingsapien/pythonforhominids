### Class Description

Data analysis is becoming more important in our everyday work. Data is everywhere and it can be difficult to handle, clean and derive insight from. In this lab we will download a slice of FCC wireless licensing data and work with it to practice data cleaning, analysis and plotting with **Pandas**, python's powerful data analysis package.

### Data Description - FCC wireless Data Analysis

Access to specific radio bands is becoming more important. The allocation of the rights to use these bands is regulated by the FCC and and publically announced in by the Universal Licensing System. In the image below you can see the allocation of specific bands across the radio spectrum as of 2016. In this lab we will download a slice of this data.

<p>This is the fourth in a series intended to teach you the essential basics of programming using Python and how to apply these basics to **make cool things**. The course can be taken a-la-carte based on the topic or can be attended regularly to become a well rounded python coder. I will cover all aspects of python language over the series. </p>

**In the FCC Data Analysis class you will:** 

* Handle a large data set from a government source

* Load and parse the data

* Conduct quaility control and exploration

* Communicate your findings with visulaization

* Come prepared to learn by doing

## Set-up

The class will be taught on your laptop by leveraging jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda Package manager. You must bring a laptop to take this class. If you are able to install anaconda and and run a jupyter notebook before you come to class we will be able to save some time. Anaconda is [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). **Be sure to allow the installer to set your PATH** when you are given the option (it is not the default).


## About Python 
Python is an open source language that will run on a variety of platforms. With this
class you'll be able to write programs for Raspberry Pi, the web, Windows
PCs, and many other applications. The basics taught in this class will relate
to many other programming languages. Let this class be a stepping stone
to help you with your own projects or even a career in programming.
