We will use the classic X-Y plotter (turtle) to act as a rover that searches an arena in your computer. The vitrual bot will search according to algorithmic rules that you write in python! ** You will learn python while doing as you write algorithms to search a simple space and make decisions based on data that your rover collects and stores in the python builtin objects. **
<p>This is the third in a series intended to teach you the essential basics of programming using Python and how to apply these basics to **make cool things**. The course can be taken a-la-carte based on the topic or can be attended regularly to become a well rounded python coder. I will cover all aspects of python language over the series. </p>

**In the virtual rover class** 
* Learn about the key components of python* code search algorythims in python* record algorithmic behavior with the X-Y plotter turtle
* Come prepared to learn by doing the fundamentals class require a heavy amout of hands on practices.
* **Get lots of practice**
The class will be taught on your laptop by leveraging jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda Package manager. You must bring a laptop to take this class.

## About Python 
Python is an open source language that will run on a variety of platforms. With thisclass you'll be able to write programs for Raspberry Pi, the web, WindowsPCs, and many other applications. The basics taught in this class will relateto many other programming languages. Let this class be a stepping stoneto help you with your own projects or even a career in programming.
