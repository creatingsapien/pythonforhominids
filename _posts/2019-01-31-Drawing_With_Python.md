<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/drawingFl2.jpg">

this class is the first in a series intended to teach you the essential basics of programming using Python and how to apply these basics to make things. The course can be taken a-la-carte based on the topic or can be attended regularly to become a well rounded python coder. I will cover all aspects of python language over the series.

**In class 1 you will learn** 

* Basic programming concepts such as variables, math operations 
* Data structures, and procedural loops
* Programming style and etiquette
* Learn to draft an image based on a simple set of mathematical rules

The class will be taught on your laptop by leveraging jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda Package manager
You must bring a laptop to take this class.

The first installment will show you how to use pythonâ€™s implementation of turtle to generate geometric designs that can be laser engraved onto wood or other objects.  Learn the fundamentals of python while making something cool!
